# Alien's Baklava

**Alien's Baklava** is a 2D top-down adventure game where you play as an alien on a daring mission to deliver baklava to your grandmother in a universe where baklava is illegal. This project is primarily developed by [Göktuğ Kola](https://github.com/Goktugkola), with contributions from an amazing team of collaborators.

## Story

The story begins with our alien protagonist discovering a batch of baklava left by his mother for his grandmother. Just as he boards his spaceship to start the delivery, a shocking announcement is made on the radio: **baklava is illegal in this universe!**

This revelation sets the stage for an exciting adventure. Through a slide-style cutscene, the player learns the stakes and embarks on the journey. The mission is simple but dangerous: navigate through gravitational planets, space rocks, and avoid the relentless pursuit of the police to deliver the forbidden baklava.
